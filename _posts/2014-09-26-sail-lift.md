<span style="color: #141823;">On Tuesday we have a crane arriving at 9am to lift off the old sails and the fantail so that they can be repaired, and then lift on the new sails which we&#8217;ve been repairing over the last many months. All in all a very important (and probably very long) day. (Photos to follow after the event.)</span>
