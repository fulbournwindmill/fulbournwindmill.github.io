As you can see from the photo taken on the Sail Day, our fantail is in need of quite a bit of tender, loving care and this money will help significantly.

We&#8217;d like to say a big thank you to the Mills Section of the <a title="SPAB Mills Section" href="https://www.spab.org.uk/spab-mills-section/" target="_blank">Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings</a> (SPAB). They have awarded us a grant of £850 towards the new fantail.


We welcome all donations so do <a title="Contact Us" href="/contact-us/" target="_blank">contact us</a>, if you would like to donate, or come and see us at one of our monthly open days.
