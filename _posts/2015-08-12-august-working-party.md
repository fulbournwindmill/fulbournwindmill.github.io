The second set of sails is coming on well. Paul has been fitting the stays into the angled holes. Each hole is at a slightly different angle.

Meanwhile, William and Ian have been painting the fan shaft and the rings that will keep the fly stocks in place.

Gradually, we&#8217;ll be able to assemble all the parts for the second set of sails and the fan. Once everything fits together on the ground, we&#8217;ll be able to book the crane and lift everything into place. Current thinking is that we might be able to do this some time in October (keep an eye on this website and on Facebook for details).

If you’re interested in volunteering, then [register your interest here](/volunteers) and we’ll be in touch.
