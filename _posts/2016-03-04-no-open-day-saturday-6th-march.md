Unfortunately there won&#8217;t be an open day or working party on Saturday 6th March. We were really hoping to dismantle the second set of sails in preparation for a crane coming in to lift them into position, but unfortunately, the weather forecast for both tomorrow (Saturday) and Wednesday when we were hoping to lift them is pretty horrible.

I&#8217;ll post again as soon as we have aÂ date confirmed for the sail lift.
