It&#8217;s National Mills Weekend on 14th and 15th May. Windmills all over the country will be open, for more details see [National Mills Weekend](http://www.nationalmillsweekend.co.uk/). Fulbourn mill will be open on Saturday from 10am onwards. Do come and see round.  <!--break-->

We&#8217;ve been trying to find a date when the weather and crane are both benign and available at the same time and that&#8217;s proven much more difficult than we hoped. However, we&#8217;re really hoping that Tuesday 17th May will be the day. If all goes according to plan, we&#8217;ll be disassembling the second set of sails that we&#8217;ve made and then getting them ready for lifting into place on Tuesday. Fingers crossed!
