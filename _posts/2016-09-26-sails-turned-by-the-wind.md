On 8th September, we had the sails turnied by the wind for the first time in a very long time. There&#8217;s still loads to do, in particular we have to make sure that the cap can turn easily, currently it&#8217;s out of alignment and really stiff, so we can&#8217;t let the wind turn the sails into the wind (yet).
