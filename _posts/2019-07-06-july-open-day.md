Hi all, we do have enough volunteers for this Saturday, so we'll be open from around 10am until about 4pm.

Come and let us show you round. Or, feel free to lend a hand.

This photo was apparently taken circa 1910 and comes from a small set of archive photos we have. 
It's a little bit difficult to see but the gallery is missing. Same as now! We're currently working on this, making
the parts at ground level and when they're all ready we'll lift them up and assemble them.
