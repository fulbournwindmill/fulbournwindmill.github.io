Hi all, unfortunately again we don't have enough volunteers for the 1st Saturday of August, but we do for Satuday 17th so we'll be open from around 10am until about 4-4.30pm.

Come and let us show you round. Or, feel free to lend a hand.

This picture was taken on a July evening in the lovely sunshine.
