## Fulbourn Windmill Society Membership

The Society undertakes the restoration of Fulbourn Windmill, which is held by a legally established Trust on behalf of the Village. The work is done by volunteers, but funds from member&#8217;s subscriptions and donations are needed for materials to continue with the restoration.

Membership of the Society entitles members to free entry to the Windmill on the annual Open Day and Working Party days.

Postal subscribers can receive the annual Newsletter and a copy of the 32 page Fulbourn Windmill colour booklet as an Adobe Acrobat .pdf file as an e-mail.

Please print this page and complete:
